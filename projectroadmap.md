The project aims to develop a turn-based game or application that includes features such as initiative tracking, turn order management, and player health tracking. The initial focus is on implementing basic functionality for initiative tracking and turn order, with plans to expand the project to include player health tracking and other features in subsequent iterations.


Tasks
Implement Initiative Tracking: Develop functionality to input player names and initiative values, and display them in order of initiative.
Turn Order Management: Add functionality to manage turn order based on initiative values, allowing players to take turns in the correct sequence.
Player Health Tracking: Integrate player health tracking into the application, allowing players to input and update their health values as needed.
Refinement and Testing: Refine the functionality of the application, addressing any bugs or issues that arise during testing. Ensure that all features work as intended and provide a smooth user experience.
User Interface Enhancement: Improve the user interface to make it more intuitive and visually appealing. Consider adding graphics or animations to enhance the gaming experience.

Week 2 Tasks

Initiative Tracking Implementation: Complete the implementation of initiative tracking functionality, ensuring that player names and initiative values are captured accurately and displayed in the correct order.
Turn Order Logic: Finalize the logic for turn order management, ensuring that players take turns in the correct sequence based on their initiative values.
