I found some code that does the basic initiative. It asks for name, and then inititiave. After pressing enter on the blank entry it spews out the names and initiatives in order.(done) 
Its a good start, but i will need to modify it to ask for health as well, shouldn't be too hard. But i do think that it will be hard to link health with name.
The code work pretty well. will need to work on pulling the names for turn order.(done)

added turn functionality, but still need to add the ability to ask for player's health, 

need to also figure out how to get the list appending right, comes up with numbers instead of the names.

just tried to add health tracking, doesn't work like i want it to, will have to tweak it some more
