# Health-and-Initiative-Tracker
A DnD initiative tracker that tells whose turn it is and tracks peoples health.

Initial plan:

1. you input statistics of who is in the combat: their name, health, team, and initiate. when puting in initiative you are given the option to roll for it as well.
2. the program will then rank the combatants in order of their initiative, and give you the first person in the turn order
3. it will give you the option to look at the health of all the comabatants, effect the health of others, or end their turn.
4. if a comabatants health is dropped to 0, it will ask if they are player. if they are not, they are taken out of the turn order. If they are, they are left in the turn order, but will be asked if they are dead. If dead, they are taken out of initiative.
5. Once there is only one team left, then combat is over, and the program will stop.
